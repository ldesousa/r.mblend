<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This module implements Mblend, a DEM merging method proposed by Leitão <i>et al.</i> (2016). It deals with cases where a study area is only partially covered by a high resolution DEM, with a coarser DEM available for the remainder. <i>r.mblend</i> merges the two DEMs, producing a smooth transition from the high resolution DEM to the low resolution DEM.

The module works by identifying the edge between the two rasters (near edge) and the edge composed by the cells in the low resolution DEM farther away from the high resolution raster (far edge). To each point along the near edge is assigned the difference between the two DEMs. To each point in the far edge is assigned the value 0. The IDW method is then used to interpolate a new raster with the points along the two edges. This differences raster is finally added to input low resolution DEM.

In the resulting DEM, cells along the near edge take the values in the high resolution raster. The farther away its are from the near edge (and closer to to the far edge) the closer their value is to the low resolution raster.  

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Merge <tt>best_dem</tt> and <tt>other_dem</tt> raster maps from the current mapset:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.mblend high=best_dem low=other_dem output=result
</pre></div>

Modifying the far edge distance cut-off:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.mblend high=best_dem low=other_dem output=result far_edge=90
</pre></div>
